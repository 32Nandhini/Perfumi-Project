      <p>
        Nature is magical as it provides for all our needs and Essential Oils
        are nature's perfume. They are compounds that are taken out of plants,
        that capture their essence.

      <h2>"Fragrance speaks louder than words.”</h2>
      <p>
        Nothing is more memorable than a smell. One scent can be unexpected,
        momentary, and fleeting, yet conjure up a childhood summer beside a lake
        in the mountains. – Robert Green Ingersoll

      perfumery means that the notes themselves are varied and can differ
      greatly from one another. The main floral categories include rose, white,
      spicy, transparent, and powdery.
